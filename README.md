# sbcl-librarian

An opinionated interface for creating C- and Python-compatible shared libraries in Common Lisp with SBCL. Requires SBCL
version >2.1.10.

## Building the libcalc example

You can build the example library using the Makefile in the `examples/libcalc`
directory, which produces a header file, a source file, and a core
file

You can compile the example like so with:

```
export SBCL_SRC=~/.roswell/src/sbcl-2.2.4

cd examples/libcalc
make

./example
```

which creates a shared library and executable using the functions
defined in the example system, assuming you have `libsbcl.so`
in a `${SBCL_SRC}/src/runtime/`.

The file `add-on.lisp` in the `example/libcalc` directory shows how to add new
API symbols at link time - the final artifact should be relinked into
the final executable either by static or dynamic linkage - things work
better on Windows with static linkage. `add-on.fasl` should be loaded
explicitly via the C function `lisp_load` or the Lisp function
`lisp-load` at runtime.

If you don't have `libsbcl.so`, make will try to build it for you
by calling `make-shared-library.sh` at `${SBCL_SRC}` directory.


### Gotcha on Intel macOS

On Intel macOS you *MUST* specify `-pagezero_size 0x100000`
when linking the final executable, otherwise SBCL will fail to mmap
its static space into the address `0x5000000`. This is because Mac
decides to make page zero take up a whole 4GB (!), which prevents
access to the 32-bit address space. (Ostensibly to prevent null
pointer or other such bad (truncated?) pointer dereferences.)


## Runtime notes

The SBCL runtime includes a garbage collector and memory allocator.

Process resources SBCL uses:
- Signal handlers into the process for things like keyboard interrupts
  (can be turned off). On some platforms this may also entail a
  stop-the-world GC signal.
- File descriptors like standard input and output.
- A fixed address space somewhere in memory. On x86 (32-bit and
  64-bit) this needs to be a fixed address space under 4 GB. This is
  so the compiler can generate manifest literal addresses in machine
  code on some platforms, as well as to compute stable hashes of
  certain constants like NIL.
