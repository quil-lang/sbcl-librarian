library and calls its init function, followed by a sequence of
bindings, which create wrappers for the functions exported by the
shared library.

loading the shared library.

TEXT-BETWEEN-HEADER-AND-EXPORTS is inserted verbatim after the header
and before the bindings.

the provided path instead of using ctypes.util.find_library.

If WRITE-PYTHON-HEADER-FN is provided, then call that function instead
of WRITE-DEFAULT-PYTHON-HEADER to generate the header text. The
